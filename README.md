This is my website that I build on Nuxt 3. I use it as my playground to try new things and have fun. Feel free to give it a feel and copy anything you like as the code is open source; so if it helps you, great. All content is written in markdown using Nuxt Content v2 and it makes adding new posts, videos etc very easy.
